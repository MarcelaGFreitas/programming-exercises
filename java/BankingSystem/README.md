# Banking System (Java)

## Description
A simple console-based banking system developed in Java as part of my programming fundamentals studies.

The system allows users to:
- Register a bank account
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money

All interactions are handled through a console menu using loops and conditional structures.

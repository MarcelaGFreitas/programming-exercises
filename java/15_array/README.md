# Sort Array Exercise
A simple Java program that sorts a 5-position integer array in ascending order without using built-in methods.

## Description
This exercise was built with the goal of practicing programming logic without relying on built-in sorting methods like `Arrays.sort()`.

The current version implements the **traditional Bubble Sort** algorithm. The next update will implement an **optimized Bubble Sort** version.

## What this version does
* Reads 5 integers from user input
* Attempts to sort the array in ascending order
* Displays the sorted array

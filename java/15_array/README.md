# Sort Array Exercise
A simple Java program that sorts a 5-position integer array in ascending order without using built-in methods.

## Description
This is an initial version of the exercise, built with the goal of practicing programming logic without relying on built-in sorting methods like `Arrays.sort()`.

The next update will implement the **Bubble Sort** manual algorithm as the sorting solution.

## What this version does
* Reads 5 integers from user input
* Attempts to sort the array in ascending order
* Displays the sorted array
